# Fourier Neural Operators
The aim of this project is to compare the predictive performance and computational efficiency of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) with those of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), followed by a full deep dive into tuning the hyperparameters of our FNO to produce the best results with the equipment at hand.
